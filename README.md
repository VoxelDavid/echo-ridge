# Echo Ridge

This is a recreation of a recreation of the Echo Ridge level in Mega Man Star
Force 3. I made a copy of Echo Ridge on [ROBLOX][roblox] a little over 4 years
ago. I really like the Echo Ridge level, but my recreation doesn't do it
justice.

I decided on a whim to make a *new* recreation, and while working I kept
thinking about all the cool features I could add. Simply adding scripts with no
version control wasn't going to fly, so I created this repository with a copy of
[Nevermore][nevermore]. Now the foundation is in place to do all sorts of neat
things on Echo Ridge.
